# sheet-posting

## _yes, because of the pun_

Sheet-posting allows you to manage a blog via Google Sheets, by taking content from your spreadsheet, converting it to JSON, then translating that to an HTML page. It can even create an RSS feed for you!

To get started, [copy this Google Sheets template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VZcd3MKIrrgRd9DrnUoEjEvzO4Gm6iDDBhw56i9CFXY/copy) and submit it into the form on the main page. That should take you to a new page that contains your unique blog. 

Then, all you have to do is copy the URL and share it with your friends! 

Sheet-posting **does not save** any information about your spreadsheet. If you'd like to stop publishing, just set your sheet's permissions back to **restricted**.
